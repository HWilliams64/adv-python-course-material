# Object oriented programming

In this module, we will learn how to represent everyday objects in a
computer program. This is known as object-oriented programming. We will learn
how to create a blueprint for objects known as Classes and we will examine how to
use classes to create multiple instances of the same object. Finally, we will
learn about. methods and how they interact with the object's instances variables. 

**No, you don't have to read or watch everything. Pick the medium(s) that fit
your learning style.**
