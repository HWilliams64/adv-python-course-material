    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression for item in iterable]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `expression` is an output expression producing items for the new list, `item` is a variable that takes each value in the iterable sequence (like a list, tuple, or string), and `iterable` is a sequence, an iterator, or other objects that we can iterate on."

    "## Why Use List Comprehension?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "They are more compact, readable, and often faster than traditional `for` loops or `lambda` functions, especially for simple operations that need to be applied to a sequence.\n"
