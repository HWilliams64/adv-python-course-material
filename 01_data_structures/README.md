# Data Structures

In this module, we will learn how to store data in objects known as data
structures. Specifically, we will learn about linear data structures known as
lists, tuples, sets and directories. We will manipulate them, and iterate
through their contents.

**No, you don't have to read or watch everything. Pick the medium(s) that fit
