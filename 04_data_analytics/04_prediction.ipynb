    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Required Libraries**:\n",
    "   - `from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler`: Imports the `MinMaxScaler` class from scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library. `MinMaxScaler` is used for scaling features to a given range.\n",
    "   - `import numpy as np`: Imports the NumPy library, which is fundamental for scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selecting Features to Scale**:\n",
    "   - `features = ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', \"transactions\", \"vwap\"]`: Defines a list of column names from the DataFrame `df` that will be scaled. These columns represent different attributes of stock prices, including the opening price (`open`), the highest price in the interval (`high`), the lowest price in the interval (`low`), the closing price (`close`), the number of shares traded (`volume`), the number of transactions (`transactions`), and the volume-weighted average price (`vwap`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extracting Data for Scaling**:\n",
    "   - `data = df[features]`: Extracts the columns specified in the `features` list from the DataFrame `df`. This creates a new DataFrame `data` containing only the columns that need to be scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scaling the Data**:\n",
    "   - `scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))`: Creates an instance of the `MinMaxScaler` class. The parameter `feature_range=(0, 1)` specifies that the scaled values should fall within the range of 0 to 1.\n",
    "   - `scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)`: The `fit_transform` method computes the minimum and maximum values of `data` to perform the scaling (fit part) and then scales the `data` (transform part). The result is a NumPy array `scaled_data` where each original value in `data` is scaled to a value between 0 and 1.\n",

LSTM networks require input data in the form of sequences for making predictions based on time series data. Here's a detailed explanation of each part of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining the `create_sequences` Function**:\n",
    "   - The function `create_sequences(data, sequence_length)` takes two parameters: `data`, which is a dataset containing scaled features, and `sequence_length`, which defines the length of the sequences to be created. The `sequence_length` is essentially the number of time steps the LSTM will look back to make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initializing Empty Lists for Sequences and Labels**:\n",
    "   - `X, y = [], []`: Initializes two empty lists, `X` and `y`. `X` will store the input sequences, and `y` will store the corresponding labels (or targets) for each sequence. In the context of stock price prediction, a sequence in `X` consists of stock prices and other features over a specified period, while the corresponding label in `y` is the price we want to predict at the next time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating Sequences and Corresponding Labels**:\n",
    "   - The `for` loop iterates through the `data`, creating sequences of length `sequence_length` and appending them to `X`. For each sequence in `X`, it also appends the next value of the closing price (assumed to be at index 3 in the `data` array) to `y` as the label.\n",
    "   - `data[i:(i + sequence_length)]`: This slice of `data` takes `sequence_length` consecutive values starting from index `i`, creating a sequence that is added to `X`.\n",
    "   - `data[i + sequence_length, 3]`: This accesses the closing price (`close`), which is immediately after the end of the current sequence, and adds it to `y` as the label for the sequence. The assumption here is that the 'close' price is at index 3 of the `data` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Converting Lists to NumPy Arrays**:\n",
    "   - `return np.array(X), np.array(y)`: The function returns two NumPy arrays, `X` and `y`. Converting the lists to NumPy arrays is important for compatibility with TensorFlow and Keras, which are used to build and train the LSTM model. NumPy arrays provide efficient storage and computation capabilities, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Specifying the Sequence Length**:\n",
    "   - `sequence_length = 60`: This sets the `sequence_length` to 60, meaning each sequence will contain data for 60 minutes. This parameter can be adjusted based on the frequency of the data and the specific requirements of the prediction task.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Generating Sequences and Labels**:\n",
    "   - `X, y = create_sequences(scaled_df.values, sequence_length)`: Calls the `create_sequences` function with the scaled data (`scaled_df.values`) and the specified `sequence_length` to generate the input sequences (`X`) and their corresponding labels (`y`).\n",

The model employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, which are well-suited for learning from sequences of data, along with Dropout layers to prevent overfitting. Here's a detailed explanation of each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Required Modules**:\n",
    "   - `from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential`: Imports the `Sequential` model class from TensorFlow's Keras API. A `Sequential` model is a linear stack of layers.\n",
    "   - `from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout`: Imports the `LSTM`, `Dense`, and `Dropout` layer classes. `LSTM` layers are used for sequence prediction problems, `Dense` layers are fully connected neural network layers, and `Dropout` layers help prevent overfitting by randomly setting input units to 0 during training.\n",
    "   - `from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam`: Imports the `Adam` optimizer, a popular algorithm for training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Building the Sequential Model**:\n",
    "   - `model = Sequential([...])`: Initializes a new Sequential model. The model is defined by passing a list of layers to the `Sequential` constructor. This list specifies the architecture of the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Defining the Model Architecture**:\n",
    "   - The model architecture consists of three LSTM layers and three Dropout layers, ending with a Dense layer.\n",
    "   - `LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2]))`: The first layer is an LSTM layer with 50 units. The `return_sequences=True` argument is necessary for stacking LSTM layers so that the subsequent LSTM layer receives sequences as input. The `input_shape` is specified according to the shape of the training data, allowing the model to know the input dimensionality.\n",
    "   - `Dropout(0.2)`: Following each LSTM layer (except the last), a Dropout layer is added with a rate of 0.2, meaning 20% of the input units are randomly set to 0 during training, which helps in preventing overfitting.\n",
    "   - `Dense(1)`: The final layer is a Dense layer with a single unit. In the context of stock price prediction, this output corresponds to the predicted value of the stock price at the next time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compiling the Model**:\n",
    "   - `model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='mean_squared_error')`: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, with a learning rate of 0.001, and the mean squared error loss function. The choice of loss function is appropriate for regression problems, where the goal is to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values.\n",

A comprehensive list of available layers can be found on the Keras documentation website at [https://keras.io/api/layers/](https://keras.io/api/layers/). Each layer type offers different functionalities, such as `Conv1D` for convolutional operations on sequences or `Bidirectional` to make your LSTM layers process the sequences in both directions.\n",

    "\n",
    "**In the train phase:**\n",
    "- **Epochs**: Increase this to add more training phases. More epochs mean the model will have more opportunities to learn from the data, but watch out for overfitting.\n",
    "- **Batch Size**: Experiment with the batch size. A smaller batch size might increase training time but can lead to a more stable and fine-tuned learning process.\n",
    "- **Validation Split**: Adjust the percentage of data used for validation during training. Finding the right balance between training and validation data can help in building a model that generalizes well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation and Metrics:**\n",
    "- Consider using additional metrics for evaluation, such as `R^2` score, to get a better sense of how well your model is performing.\n",
