    "1. **Defining the Decorator**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `my_decorator` is our decorator function. It takes another function `func` as an argument. This `func` is the function we intend to decorate.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Inside `my_decorator`, we define another function named `wrapper`. This function is where we add the new functionality we want to introduce. \n",
    "- In this example, `wrapper` adds two print statements to run before and after `func` is called.\n",
    "- Note that `wrapper` calls `func` directly, meaning it executes the original function passed to `my_decorator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Returning the New Function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `my_decorator` returns `wrapper` as its result. The returned `wrapper` function is now a decorated version of the original `func`, enhanced with additional functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applying the Decorator**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `@my_decorator` syntax is syntactic sugar for `say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)`.\n",

    "### Breaking Down the Example\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining the Decorator Factory**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The outermost function `repeat(num_times)` is not the decorator itself but a decorator factory that accepts arguments for the decorator. In this case, `num_times` specifies how many times the decorated function should be repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating the Decorator**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inside `repeat`, the `decorator_repeat(func)` function is the actual decorator. It takes a function `func` to be decorated. This layer is necessary to accept and preserve the decorator arguments (`num_times`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adding the Wrapper Function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The innermost function, `wrapper(*args, **kwargs)`, is where the additional functionality is applied. It allows the decorated function to accept any number of positional and keyword arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`), making the decorator applicable to functions with various signatures.\n",
    "- Inside `wrapper`, the decorated function `func` is called `num_times`, each time passing along any arguments it received.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applying the Decorator with Arguments**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To use the decorator, you prepend the function definition with `@repeat(num_times=3)`. This applies `repeat` to `greet`, causing `greet` to be called three times whenever it is invoked.\n"

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "### How It Works Internally\n",
    "\n",
    "- When Python encounters `@repeat(num_times=3)`, it calls `repeat(3)`. This returns the `decorator_repeat` function.\n",
    "- `decorator_repeat` is then applied to `greet`, returning the `wrapper` function, which replaces `greet`.\n",
    "- Now, when `greet` is called, it actually executes `wrapper`, which runs `greet` three times.\n"

    "- **Reusability**: The same decorator can be applied in different ways to different functions, enhancing code reusability.\n",
    "- **Clarity**: They can make the intention behind the use of a decorator clearer by explicitly specifying arguments.\n"
