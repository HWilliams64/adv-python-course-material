# Context Managers and Decorators in Python

Welcome to the Context Managers and Decorators in Python module! In this module,
you'll embark on a journey into advanced Python programming concepts, focusing
on creating context managers and decorators. Context managers provide a clean
and efficient way to manage resources, while decorators offer a powerful means
to modify or extend the behavior of functions. 

## Module Topics:
1. Understanding Context Managers:
   - Explore the concept of context management in Python.
   - Learn the role of the `with` statement in managing resources.
   - Discover how to create custom context managers for efficient resource handling.
   - Practice implementing context managers to enhance code readability and maintainability.

2. Creating Custom Context Managers:
   - Dive deeper into building custom context managers.
   - Understand the use of the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.
   - Explore the contextlib module for context manager creation.
   - Practice designing and implementing context managers tailored to specific needs.

3. Decorators: A Powerful Tool in Python:
   - Grasp the significance of decorators in Python programming.
   - Learn how decorators modify or extend the behavior of functions.
   - Explore the syntax and application of decorators in various scenarios.
   - Practice using decorators to enhance the functionality of your Python functions.

4. Building Custom Decorators:
   - Extend your knowledge by creating custom decorators.
   - Understand the role of wrapper functions in the decorator pattern.
   - Explore common use cases for decorators, such as logging and timing.
   - Practice designing and applying custom decorators to add functionality to functions.

Throughout this module, you'll reinforce your understanding through hands-on
exercises and practical examples. These activities will empower you to
confidently create context managers for efficient resource management and
leverage decorators to enhance the functionality of your Python code. By the end
of the module, you'll possess valuable skills in advanced Python programming,
enabling you to write cleaner, more modular, and expressive code. Get ready to
elevate your Python programming expertise with context managers and decorators!
