    "# Python Context Managers and Cleanup\n",

    "As we venture deeper into the fascinating world of Python, we stumble upon a powerful feature known as context managers. Context managers allow us to properly manage resources so we can avoid leaving open connections or having locked resources. They're ideal for handling setup and cleanup procedures, which might be difficult to manage due to exceptions or multiple return paths.\n",

    "The magic of context managers is in two special methods: `__enter__` and `__exit__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__enter__` method is executed at the beginning of the `with` block. In the file example above, this method opens the file and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__exit__` method is executed at the end of the `with` block — even if the block is exited due to an exception. This method takes care of the cleanup. In the file example, it closes the file.\n"
