# Data Structures

In this module, we will learn how to read and write text to a text file.
Additionally, we will discuss saving and loading data structures and other
objects as text. We will do this by converting Javascript Object Notation
(JSON) strings and saving the JSON string to a text file.

**No, you don't have to read or watch everything. Pick the medium(s) that fit
