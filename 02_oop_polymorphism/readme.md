# Object-Oriented (Polymorphism) Programming

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming in Python module! In this module, you'll delve into the world of objects, exploring their fundamental role in the world of Python programming. Objects, and the classes that define them, form the basis for a programming paradigm known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). We'll cover key topics like defining classes, creating methods, understanding the concept of getters and setters, and the use of local or instance variables.

## Module Topics:
1. Understanding Objects and Classes:
   - Understand the concept of an object in programming.
   - Learn how classes define objects with a certain behavior and properties.
   - Discover the power and flexibility of objects for creating complex programs.
   - Practice creating classes and instantiating objects.

2. Methods vs Functions:
   - Learn the difference between a method and a function.
   - Understand how methods, as part of a class, can modify an object's state.
   - Discover the use of the 'self' parameter in Python methods.
   - Practice creating methods within classes to manipulate and interact with objects.

3. Getters and Setters:
   - Understand the concept of getters and setters in object-oriented programming.
   - Learn the importance of encapsulation, and how getters and setters contribute to it.
   - Explore Python's property decorator to create getters and setters.
   - Practice creating classes with getters and setters to safely manipulate object attributes.

4. Local and Instance Variables:
   - Learn the difference between local and instance variables.
   - Understand how instance variables allow data to be stored on a per-object basis.
   - Discover the lifecycle of local variables and their scope.
   - Practice using local and instance variables to build dynamic objects.

5. Defining and Using Class Methods:
   - Understand the purpose and syntax of methods within classes.
   - Learn how to define and use methods to manipulate object state and behavior.
   - Explore the role of the 'self' keyword in instance methods.
   - Practice creating methods within classes to interact with and manipulate objects.

6. Polymorphism and inheritance:
   - The act of extending on class with another parent class
   - Functional overriding

Throughout this module, you'll have the chance to consolidate your understanding through practical exercises and programming challenges. These activities will bolster your understanding of object-oriented programming and its various aspects. By the end of the module, you'll have the skills to define classes, create methods, understand the role of getters and setters, and use local and instance variables effectively.

Remember to strive for clean and reusable code, and to challenge yourself by solving diverse programming problems using object-oriented principles. Developing a strong foundation in object-oriented programming will enhance your ability to create modular and efficient Python programs. Buckle up for an exciting journey into the world of object-oriented programming in Python!
