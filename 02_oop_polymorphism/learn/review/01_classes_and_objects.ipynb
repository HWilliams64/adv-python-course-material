    "# Python Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll go through Python classes, objects, methods, variables,\n",
    "and some fundamental concepts associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, a class is a blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming. It's a user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes and methods that characterize any object of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The attributes are data members or variables that hold the state of the object, while the methods define what the object can do, i.e., the behavior of the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a class as a blueprint for a house. It defines the dimensions, layout, and materials but doesn't exist as a physical entity until it's built. Once you have the blueprint, you can build as many houses as you want from it, and each house (an instance of the class) can have its own specific characteristics (instance variables) like color, decor, etc., while adhering to the blueprint. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a `Car` class. The class might define attributes like\n",
    "`make`, `model`, and `color`, and methods like `drive`, `brake`, and `park`. You\n",
    "can then create instances (objects) of the `Car` class like `myCar` or\n",
    "`yourCar`, each with its own specific make, model, and color.\n",
