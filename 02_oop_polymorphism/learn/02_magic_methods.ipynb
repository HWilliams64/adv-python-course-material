    "# Magic Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic methods in Python are special methods that add \"magic\" to your classes. They're also called dunder methods because they begin and end with double underscores (`__`). Magic methods allow your objects to implement, support, and interact with basic language constructs such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Looping\n",
    "- Collections\n",
    "- Attribute access\n",
    "- Operator overloading\n",
    "- Function and method invocation\n",
    "- Object creation and destruction\n",
    "- String representation and formatting\n",
    "- Managed contexts (i.e., with blocks)\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of magic methods is to enable you to define the behavior and emulate the built-in types of Python. For example, you can make your own objects iterable, make them behave like functions, or even mimic numeric types.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key aspect of magic methods is operator overloading, which is the practice of defining what an operator (+, -, *, /, etc.) does in relation to your objects. For example, by defining a `__add__` method in your class, you're telling Python how to handle the `+` operator when it's used with instances of your class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another significant aspect is controlling the creation and destruction of objects through the `__init__` and `__del__` methods. These allow you to manage resources when an object is created or discarded, like opening or closing file or network connections, or allocating or releasing heavy system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, magic methods are a powerful tool that allows you to build your own objects that integrate seamlessly with Python's idiomatic expressions, making your classes more Pythonic and intuitive to use."

    "\n",
    "- `__sub__`: Overloads the `-` operator. It allows you to define subtraction between two instances of your class or an instance of your class and another type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__mul__`: Overloads the `*` operator. You can use it to define multiplication of your object with another object or value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__div__`: Overloads the `/` operator. You can use it to define the division of your object by another object or value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`: These methods overload the `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` comparison operators, respectively. They can be used to provide custom comparisons between instances of your class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`: These methods are used to implement functionality similar to accessing and setting elements in a list or dictionary using square brackets. They enable you to use the `[]` operator to get or set values in your object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__del__`: This method is called when an object is about to be destroyed (although exactly when is not guaranteed). It can be useful for cleaning up resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__iter__`, `__next__`: These methods are used to make an object iterable, i.e., capable of being looped over. The `__iter__` method should return the object itself (usually), and the `__next__` method should return the next value of the iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__enter__`, `__exit__`: These methods are used to define a managed context. They are executed at the beginning and end of a `with` block, respectively, and allow for proper setup and cleanup of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "These magic methods allow you to leverage Python's syntactic sugar and to make your classes behave like built-in types, which can lead to more readable, idiomatic code."
