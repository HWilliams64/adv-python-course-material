    "## Introduction to Multi-Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-processing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. In Python, the `multiprocessing` module allows you to create processes that can run tasks in parallel. This can significantly improve the performance of your program, especially for CPU-bound tasks that can be divided into independent subtasks.\n"

    "### Why Use Multi-Processing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-processing is used to achieve parallelism. This means tasks can be executed simultaneously on multiple cores, making your program run faster by taking advantage of the full computing power available. It's particularly beneficial for tasks that are CPU-intensive and can be divided into smaller, independent tasks.\n"

    "### Threads vs. Processes: Pros and Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between multi-processing and threading lies in how they operate within the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Threads** of the same process run in a shared memory space, but each **process** in multi-processing runs in its own memory space.\n",
    "- Threads are lighter-weight and have less overhead than processes. However, because they share the same memory space, threading can lead to issues like race conditions if not managed correctly.\n",
    "- Multi-processing avoids these issues by giving each process its own memory space, but it comes with a higher memory and CPU overhead due to the need to duplicate the memory space for each process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the difference between threads and processes is crucial when deciding how to implement concurrency in your Python applications. Here's a comparison in the form of a pros and cons table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature           | Threads                                                                 | Processes                                                               |\n",

    "| **Creation**      | Lighter weight and faster to create and destroy.                        | Heavier and slower to start and stop due to the need for more resources.|\n",
    "| **Communication** | Easier to communicate through shared memory but requires synchronization. | Communication requires IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanisms like pipes or queues, which can be more complex but safer. |\n",
    "| **Overhead**      | Lower because they share resources like memory with the parent process. | Higher because each process needs its own memory and resources.         |\n",
    "| **Use Case**      | Best for I/O-bound and light CPU-bound tasks.                          | Best for CPU-intensive tasks that can be easily parallelized.           |\n",
    "| **Safety**        | Prone to issues like race conditions due to shared memory.              | Safer in terms of memory corruption as each process has its own memory. |\n",
    "| **Efficiency**    | Can be more efficient for quick tasks and I/O operations.               | More efficient for long-running, CPU-intensive tasks.                   |\n",
