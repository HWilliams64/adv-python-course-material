    "## Tutorial: Making API Requests with Python Requests Package\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In the world of web development and data retrieval, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) play a crucial role in enabling communication between different software systems. APIs allow you to send requests to a server and receive data or perform specific actions. In this tutorial, we will explore how to make requests to an API using the Python requests package, using the `swapi.dev` API as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of\n",
    "Python programming. Additionally, make sure you have the `requests` package\n",
    "installed in your Python environment. If you are NOT working in the Grader Than\n",
    "IDE you will need to install this package. You can install it using the following\n",
    "command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an API?\n",
    "API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs expose certain functionalities of a software system, enabling other applications to make requests and retrieve data or perform specific actions. APIs are widely used for web development, data retrieval, integration between systems, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading the API Documentation\n",
    "Before making requests to an API, it's crucial to read the documentation provided by the API provider. The documentation provides information about the available endpoints, query parameters, authentication requirements, and response formats. Understanding the API documentation helps you make the correct requests and interpret the responses correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will be using the `swapi.dev` API, which provides information about the Star Wars universe. You can find the documentation for this API at [https://swapi.dev/documentation](https://swapi.dev/documentation). Take some time to familiarize yourself with the available endpoints and their functionalities.\n"

    "Above we have demonstated how to make a GET request to the swapi.dev API using the Python requests package. Let's break it down step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing the `requests` module:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import requests\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line imports the `requests` module, which provides convenient methods for making HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Defining the base URL:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   base_url = 'https://swapi.dev/api/'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Here, the `base_url` variable is set to the base URL of the swapi.dev API. This will be used as the starting point to construct the complete URL for the specific endpoint we want to request.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Constructing the endpoint URL:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   endpoint = 'films/1/'\n",
    "   url = base_url + endpoint\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   In this code, we define the specific endpoint we want to request, which in this case is `'films/1/'`. The `url` variable is then constructed by concatenating the `base_url` and `endpoint`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Making the GET request:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   response = requests.get(url)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line sends a GET request to the API using the `requests.get()` function. It takes the `url` as an argument and returns a `response` object that contains the server's response to the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing this code, the `response` object will contain the API's response to the GET request. You can further process and extract information from the response, such as checking the status code and accessing the response data."

    "\n",
    "1. `if response.status_code == 200:`:\n",
    "   This line checks if the status code of the HTTP response is equal to 200. In the HTTP protocol, a status code of 200 indicates a successful response.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. `data = response.json()`:\n",
    "   After printing the success message, this line retrieves the response body and converts it to a JSON format. The `response.json()` method parses the response content assuming it is in JSON format and returns a Python dictionary or list containing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `print('Title:', data['title'])`:\n",
    "   Assuming the response body contains a JSON object with a key named 'title', this line accesses the 'title' value from the `data` dictionary and prints it along with the string 'Title:' to the console. This demonstrates accessing a specific field of the API response data.\n",

    "## Query Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "A query string is a part of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that is used to pass information or parameters to a web server when making an HTTP request. It is typically placed at the end of the URL and follows a specific syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of a query string consists of one or more key-value pairs, where each pair is separated by an ampersand (`&`). Each key-value pair is composed of a parameter name (key) and its corresponding value, separated by an equals sign (`=`). The general structure of a query string is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "?key1=value1&key2=value2&key3=value3...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the different parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `?` (Question Mark): The question mark is placed at the end of the URL's base path and indicates the start of the query string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `key`: The key represents the name or identifier of the parameter being passed. It should be descriptive and relevant to the specific API or endpoint you are working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `value`: The value is the actual data associated with the key. It can be a string, number, or other valid data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `=` (Equals Sign): The equals sign separates the key and its corresponding value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `&` (Ampersand): The ampersand is used to separate multiple key-value pairs within the query string. It allows you to include multiple parameters in a single URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following URL with a query string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://example.com/api/endpoint?key1=value1&key2=value2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the base URL is `https://example.com/api/endpoint`, and the query string consists of two key-value pairs: `key1=value1` and `key2=value2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query strings are commonly used in APIs to provide additional information or filter data retrieval. They allow users to customize API requests by passing parameters to retrieve specific data subsets, apply filters, or modify the behavior of the API response."

    "## Pagination\n",
    "\n",
    "Pagination is a technique used in APIs to handle large amounts of data by\n",
    "breaking it down into smaller, manageable portions called \"pages.\" Each page\n",
    "contains a subset of the total data, making it easier to retrieve and process.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs use pagination in the real world for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Efficient Data Transfer: Pagination allows APIs to transfer data in smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of sending the entire dataset in a single response, the API breaks it down into pages, reducing the amount of data transferred in each request. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets to optimize network usage and minimize response times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Performance Optimization: By limiting the number of results per page, APIs can improve performance by reducing the processing and rendering time required for each request. Smaller response payloads and faster processing times lead to a more responsive API experience for clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bandwidth Optimization: Pagination helps conserve bandwidth by reducing the amount of data transferred over the network. This is especially beneficial for mobile applications or scenarios where bandwidth is limited or costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Resource Constraints: Pagination allows APIs to handle limited resources more effectively. By limiting the number of results per page, APIs can distribute server resources evenly and avoid potential performance issues or out-of-memory errors when handling large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. User Experience: Pagination enables a smoother and more interactive user experience when working with large amounts of data. It allows users to retrieve and view data incrementally, providing a sense of progress and responsiveness as they navigate through different pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Rate Limiting and Throttling: APIs often enforce rate limiting or throttling mechanisms to control the number of requests made by a client within a given time frame. Pagination helps enforce these limits by dividing the dataset into pages, ensuring that clients cannot retrieve the entire dataset in a single request and potentially overload the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, pagination in APIs enhances performance, optimizes data transfer, and\n",
    "provides a more efficient and scalable approach to handling large datasets. It\n",
    "enables efficient resource utilization and improves the user experience when\n",
    "working with APIs that return a substantial amount of data.\n"

    "### Using Pagination\n",
    "\n",
    "With the swapi.dev API, pagination is employed to ensure efficient retrieval of Star Wars-related data. The API returns a limited number of results per page, and it provides mechanisms to navigate through the pages and access subsequent data.\n",

    "The swapi.dev API uses the `page` key for query parameters for pagination:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `page`: This parameter allows you to specify the page number you want to retrieve. Each page typically contains a fixed number of results (e.g., 10). By specifying the `page` parameter, you can access different subsets of the data.\n",

If the status code is not 200, it prints an error message with the actual status code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Processing the Successful Response:\n",

The `handle_pagination_response()` function is recursively called to handle the subsequent response. If there are no more pages available, it prints a message indicating that there are no more pages to retrieve.\n",

    "handle_pagination_response(response)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this section, the code sets up the base URL, endpoint, and query parameters for the initial GET request. It then makes the GET request using `requests.get()` with the constructed URL and parameters. Finally, it calls the `handle_pagination_response()` function to start handling the pagination logic and process the initial response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates a recursive approach to handle pagination in API responses. It retrieves and processes data from multiple pages until there are no more pages available, providing a way to handle large datasets returned by APIs.\n",
