    "data = response.json()\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `response.json()` method will parse the JSON response into a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just the beginning of what you can do with the `requests` library. It also supports other HTTP methods like PUT, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS, and features like custom headers, file uploads, timeouts, handling cookies, and more. Be sure to check out the [official documentation](http://docs.python-requests.org/) for more information.\n"
