    "FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. The key features are that it's fast to code and uses automatic data model validation. FastAPI integrates well with Python's asynchronous programming features, allowing you to write asynchronous applications with ease.\n"

    "\n",
    "FastAPI is a high-performance web framework for building APIs. It is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts. The framework encourages writing clean and pragmatic design, and is type-safe which means you get automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation.\n"

    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "<summary><b>üí° Click me to learn more about the code above</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is a basic example of a web application built using FastAPI. Here's what each part of the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import FastAPI**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line imports the `FastAPI` class from the `fastapi` module. FastAPI is the framework that provides all the functionality for building your API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create an App Instance**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   app = FastAPI()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line creates an instance of the `FastAPI` class. This instance `app` is the actual application that will handle all the API requests. It initializes your web application and sets it up to start receiving HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define a Route**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   @app.get(\"/\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This decorator tells FastAPI to execute the associated function (`index()`) when it receives a GET request at the URL path `/`. The `/` represents the root of the website, so in this case, the function `index()` is what responds when someone visits the main URL of your API.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Asynchronous Function**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   async def index():\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This defines an asynchronous function `index()`. Using `async` makes the function non-blocking and allows your application to handle other requests while waiting for any I/O operations within the function to complete. This is beneficial for improving the performance of your API, especially under high load.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return a Response**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The function returns a Python dictionary `{\"Hello\": \"World\"}`. In FastAPI, when you return a dictionary from a route, it is automatically converted into a JSON response. Therefore, this route will send a JSON response containing the key-value pair `{\"Hello\": \"World\"}` to the client. This JSON response is what a client will see when they navigate to the root URL of your API using a web browser or when they make a GET request to that URL using tools like `curl` or Postman.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this script sets up a very simple FastAPI application that responds to HTTP GET requests at the root endpoint (`/`) with a JSON object. It's a basic example demonstrating how to set up a web API with FastAPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",

    "  - This class is also based on Pydantic's `BaseModel` and it contains a dictionary called `notes`. This dictionary maps strings (keys) to `Note` objects. It acts as the in-memory database where all notes are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Persistent Storage Path**:\n",
    "  - `notes_file_path = \"./notes.json\"` sets the file path for storing notes. This file is used to save and read note data in JSON format, acting as a simple file-based database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions for Data Handling**:\n",
    "  - `load_notes_store()`: Checks if the `notes.json` file exists. If it does not, a new `NoteStorage` instance is returned, essentially initializing an empty storage. If the file exists, it opens the JSON file in read mode, reads the JSON data, and then validates and parses this data into a `NoteStorage` object using Pydantic‚Äôs `model_validate_json` method.\n",
    "  - `save_notes_store(new_storage: NoteStorage)`: Takes a `NoteStorage` object, serializes it into JSON using the `model_dump_json` method of Pydantic, and then writes this JSON data back to the file `notes.json`. This process overwrites the existing file with the updated data, thereby persisting changes made to the notes in the application to disk.\n",

    "### Creating a New Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of code handles the creation of a new note by generating a unique\n",
    "identifier, adding it to the persistent storage, and saving the updated list of\n",
    "notes.\n",
    "\n",

    "    note_store.notes[new_note.key] = new_note\n",
    "    save_notes_store(note_store)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **POST Endpoint**:\n",
    "  - Decorated with `@app.post(\"/note\")`, this function defines an endpoint for creating a new note via a POST request. The function is asynchronous, marked by the `async` keyword, allowing efficient I/O operations. The `new_note: Note` parameter in the function definition specifies that it expects a `Note` object as input, leveraging Pydantic's data validation to ensure proper structure and types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generating Unique Keys and Timestamps**:\n",
    "  - `new_note.key = str(uuid4())` assigns a unique identifier to the `key` attribute of the `new_note` object using Python's `uuid4()` function, ensuring every note has a unique key.\n",
    "  - `new_note.created_at = round(time.time())` sets the `created_at` timestamp to the current time in seconds, rounded to the nearest whole number, marking when the note was created.\n",
    "  - `new_note.last_modified = round(time.time())` similarly sets the `last_modified` timestamp, which initially matches the creation time but can be updated if the note is modified later.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storing and Saving the Note**:\n",
    "  - `note_store = load_notes_store()` loads the existing notes from the storage, potentially reading from a JSON file if it exists, or initializing a new storage if it doesn't.\n",
    "  - `note_store.notes[new_note.key] = new_note` adds the new note to the `notes` dictionary within the `note_store` object, using its unique key as the dictionary key.\n",
    "  - `save_notes_store(note_store)` serializes the entire `note_store` object, including the newly added note, and writes it back to the JSON file. This ensures all changes, including the addition of the new note, are saved to disk. \n",

    "- **GET Endpoint**:\n",
    "  - Decorated with `@app.get(\"/note/{key}\")`, this function sets up an endpoint to retrieve a specific note using its unique key. The `async` keyword indicates that the function is asynchronous, optimizing performance during I/O operations like file access. The `{key}` in the route dynamically captures a string identifier from the URL, which is then passed to the function as the parameter `key`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading the Note Storage**:\n",
    "  - `note_store = load_notes_store()` is called at the start to load the current state of stored notes, either from an existing JSON file or initializing an empty storage if the file doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieving the Note**:\n",
    "  - `note = note_store.notes.get(key)` attempts to find the note within the `notes` dictionary of the `note_store` using the provided `key`. The `.get()` method is used for safe access, returning `None` if the key does not exist in the dictionary, thus avoiding a KeyError.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Note**:\n",
    "  - If `note` is `None` (i.e., the note with the specified key is not found), the function raises an `HTTPException` with a status code of 404 and a detail message \"Note not found\". This informs the client through a standard HTTP error response that the requested note does not exist, enhancing the API's robustness and user feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Returning the Note**:\n",
    "  - If the note is found, it is returned as part of a JSON object wrapped in a dictionary with the key `\"note\"`. This structure ensures that the API response is well-formatted and clear, facilitating easy integration and consumption by client applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "    save_notes_store(note_store)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the updated explanation that matches the code snippet provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PATCH Endpoint**:\n",
    "  - Defined under the `@app.patch(\"/note/{key}\")` decorator, this function creates an API endpoint for updating a specific note identified by its `key`. The `async` keyword marks the function as asynchronous, enhancing efficiency during I/O operations. The endpoint handles PATCH requests which are typically used for partial updates to resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading the Note Storage and Note Retrieval**:\n",
    "  - `note_store = load_notes_store()` loads the existing note storage from a JSON file or initializes a new one if no file exists. \n",
    "  - `note = note_store.notes.get(key)` uses the `.get()` method to safely retrieve the note with the specified `key`. This method returns `None` if the key is not found, which prevents errors that would occur from attempting to access a non-existent key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Note**:\n",
    "  - If `note` is `None`, indicating that no note with the given key exists, an `HTTPException` is raised with a status code of 404. This exception provides a clear error message (\"Note not found\") to the client, effectively handling the scenario where a non-existent note is requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conditional Updates and Recording Changes**:\n",
    "  - The function checks if `new_note_data.title` is not `None`, and if so, updates the `title` of the note and sets `note.last_modified` to the current timestamp (`new_modified_time`). This pattern is repeated for the `message` field, ensuring that only provided fields are updated.\n",
    "  - `new_modified_time = round(time.time())` captures the exact time of modification, ensuring that the `last_modified` timestamp accurately reflects the latest update.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Saving Changes to Storage**:\n",
    "  - `save_notes_store(note_store)` is called to serialize the modified `note_store` back into the JSON file. This ensures that all changes, including updates to individual notes, are preserved across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation provides a robust method for updating specific fields of a\n",
    "note, demonstrating the use of PATCH for partial updates in RESTful services. \n",
